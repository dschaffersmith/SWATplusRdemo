## 04 - Visualization of simulation results

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
knitr::opts_knit$set(root.dir = rprojroot::find_rstudio_root_file())
```

## R packages

R offers a large variety of methods and packages for visualization. Most 
plotting methods are however static, which makes sense for publishing results. 
For model diagnosis, however, interactive plotting can greatly support the 
modeler. This chapter gives a brief overview of plotting methods that can 
support you in analyzing your simulation results. A great R package to visualize 
time series data and offer options such as zooming is dygraphs. It works with 
xts time series data and can support you in comparing the simulated time series 
(e.g. discharge, in-stream nitrogen etc.) with observation data. ggplot2 is a 
very versatile package for data visualization, that you have seen already 
several times in the previous chapters. plotly offers easy ways to make ggplots 
more interactive. To visualize spatial data and have functionalities that are 
usually provided by GIS software mapview provides a great alternative. It is 
based on leaflet that most of us have most likely already seen in action on web 
pages with interactive maps (and maybe did not realize that this is a leaflet 
map and we can also produce something similar with R easily).

# Package installation

If you do not have installed any of the required R package, follow the 
instructions for the respective R package. All of the required R packages are 
available from CRAN and can be installed with the following commands:

```{r pkg install}
#install.packages("dplyr")
#install.packages("dygraphs")
#install.packages("ggplot2")
#install.packages("lubridate")
#install.packages("mapview")
#install.packages("purrr")
#install.packages("plotly")
#install.packages("sf")
#install.packages("tibble")
#install.packages("tidyr")
#install.packages("xts")
#install.packages("leaflet")
#install.packages("leafsync")
```

# Loading R packages

```{r load pkg}
library(SWATplusR)
library(dplyr)
library(dygraphs)
library(ggplot2)
library(lubridate)
library(mapview)
library(plotly)
library(sf)
library(tibble)
library(tidyr)
library(leaflet)
library(leafsync)
```

## Loading demo data

The optimization example uses the SWAT+ demo project available from SWATplusR. 
The demo project is a very simple model setups of a head watershed of the Little 
River Experimental Watershed (LREW; Bosch et al., 2007). You can load the to 
your hard drive as follows:

```{r load demo}
# The path where the SWAT demo project will be written
demo_path <- 'data_input/SWAT_demo' # Update this to your path

# Loading the SWAT+ demo project on your hard drive
path_plus <- load_demo(dataset = "project",
                       version = "plus",
                       path = demo_path, 
                       revision = 57)
```

SWATplusR also provides observation data of daily discharge records at the main 
outlet of the demo for the time period 1968-01-01 until 2012-12-31. We will use 
the observation data to compare the discharge simulations with observed values:

```{r load obs}
q_obs <- load_demo(dataset = "observation")
```


## Parameter sampling

For this example we will use 7 SWAT model parameters that are frequently calibrated for discharge. Below we create a tibble (Müller and Wickham, 2019) that provides 4 parameter combinations for the 7 parameters. The parameter values that are given here resulted in acceptable simulations of discharge in the previous chapters and were just selected for demonstration here. These parameter combinations are uses throughout the following chapters. We name the parameters using the specific syntax that is requested by the run_swat*() functions (see the Get started section on ‘Model parameter alteration’ to learn more on parameter names):

```{r par samp}
par <- tibble("cn2.hru | change = abschg" = c(-4.56, -4.47, -4.89, -14.4),
              "lat_ttime.hru | change = absval" = c(1.64, 2.55, 1.08, 0.844),
              "lat_len.hru | change = absval" = c(95.2, 94.8, 42.2, 87.8),
              "k.sol | change = pctchg" = c(-45.0, -37.8, -41.1, -48.5),
              "z.sol | change = pctchg" = c(-41.0, 25.7, 12.7, 27.9),
              "esco.hru | change = absval" = c(0.809, 0.437, 0.368, 0.848),
              "epco.hru | change = absval" = c(0.165, 0.507, 0.197, 0.353))
```


## Vizualization of time series data

dygraphs offers great ways to visualize time series data. Before we can 
visualize our simulation results the data we have to perform the simulations. 
Running SWAT+ works the same way as in the previous examples:

```{r viz}
q_day <- run_swatplus(project_path = path_plus,
                      output = list(q_sim = define_output(file = "channel",
                                    variable = "flo_out",
                                    unit = 1)),
                      parameter = par,
                      start_date = "2000-01-01",
                       end_date = "2007-12-31",
                      years_skip = 3,
                      n_thread = 4,
                      revision = 57)
#Building 4 threads in 'data_input/SWAT_demo/swatplus_rev57_demo/.model_run': 
# Completed 4 threads in 1S                                                  
#Performing 4 simulations on 4 cores: 
# Completed 4 simulations in 3S 
```

You can use the function view_timeseries below as a template for your future 
SWAT-R projects. The implementation reminds of the view option you have in 
SWAT-CUP and it is a great pendant to that. The function requires the simulated 
and the observed time series in a date.frame format where in both data sets the 
first column must be the date and the following columns are the 
simulated/observed values:

```{r viz func}
view_timeseries <- function(q_sim, q_obs) {
  names(q_obs) <- c("date", "q_obs")
  
  q_xts <- q_sim %>% 
    dplyr::left_join(., q_obs, by = "date") %>% 
    xts::xts(x = .[,c(2:ncol(.))], order.by = .$date)
  
  n_sim <- ncol(q_sim) - 1
  
  dygraph(q_xts) %>% 
    dyRangeSelector() %>% 
    dyOptions(colors = 
      c(colorRampPalette( 
        RColorBrewer::brewer.pal(8, "Paired"))(n_sim), 
        "black"))
}
```


Using the function view_timeseries we can now interactively compare the four simulated time series of the discharge with the discharge observations. Again, do not forget to convert the SWAT+ discharge given in \(ha \cdot m^{-1}\) to \(m^3 \cdot s^{-1}\) with a conversion factor of \(8.64\) for daily time steps:

```{r}
q_sim <- q_day$simulation$q_sim %>% 
  mutate_if(., is.numeric, ~(./8.64)) 

view_timeseries(q_sim = q_sim, q_obs = q_obs)
```


## Visualization of the water balance components

Having an overview of the shares of the individual water balance components in a 
model setup can provide a lot of information on how well the SWAT model setup 
represents a catchment (see for instance SWATcheck as a great example for that). 
Below we will simulate basin averages of water balance components and visualize 
them in an interactive plot using ggplot2 and plotly. Again we will use 
run_swatplus to simulate the water balance components for one model 
parameterization:

```{r viz bal run}
par_wb <- par[1,]

wb_mon <- run_swatplus(project_path = path_plus,
                       output = list(pet = define_output(file = "basin_wb",
                                       variable = "pet",
                                       unit = 1),
                                     pcp = define_output(file = "basin_wb",
                                       variable = "precip",
                                       unit = 1),
                                     aet = define_output(file = "basin_wb",
                                       variable = "et",
                                       unit = 1),
                                     q_sur = define_output(file = "basin_wb",
                                       variable = "surq_gen",
                                       unit = 1),
                                     q_lat = define_output(file = "basin_wb",
                                       variable = "latq",
                                       unit = 1)),
                       parameter = par_wb,
                       start_date = "2000-01-01",
                        end_date = "2007-12-31",
                       output_interval = "m",
                       years_skip = 3,
                       revision = 57)

```{r viz bal}
wb_comp <- wb_mon$simulation %>% 
  mutate(month = month(date)) %>% 
  select(-date) %>% 
  group_by(month) %>% 
  summarise_all(., .funs = mean)

wb_land <- wb_comp %>% 
  select(-pet, -pcp) %>% 
  gather(data = ., key = "Land_phase", value = "value", - month) %>% 
  mutate(Land_phase = factor(Land_phase, levels = c("aet", "q_sur", "q_lat")))

wb_atm <- wb_comp %>% 
  select(month, pet, pcp) %>% 
  gather(data = ., key = "Atmosphere", value = "value", - month) %>% 
  mutate(Atmosphere = factor(Atmosphere, levels = c("pet", "pcp")))


gg_wb <- ggplot() + 
  geom_col(data = wb_land, 
           aes(x = month, y = value, fill = Land_phase)) + 
  geom_line(data = wb_atm, 
           aes(x = month, y = value, col = Atmosphere)) + 
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("#41AB5D", "#9ECAE1", "#08519C")) + 
  scale_color_manual(values = c("#CB181D", "#08519C")) + 
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = 1:12, labels = substr(month.abb, 1,1)) + 
  theme_bw()

ggplotly(gg_wb)
```


## Viewing spatial data

To analyze a SWAT project spatially distributed functions that are provided in 
traditional GIS can be useful. Several R packages offer implementations that 
allow quick and intuitive ways to visualize spatial data. A great example is the 
R package mapview. In the example below we calculate average annual values for 
four water balance components on the HRU scale and visualize them in an 
interactive map.

```{r run hr}
wb_hru <- run_swatplus(project_path = path_plus,
                       output = list(aet = define_output(file = "hru_wb",
                                       variable = "et",
                                       unit = 1:131),
                                     wyld = define_output(file = "hru_wb",
                                       variable = "wateryld",
                                       unit = 1:131),
                                     q_sur = define_output(file = "hru_wb",
                                       variable = "surq_gen",
                                       unit = 1:131),
                                     q_lat = define_output(file = "hru_wb",
                                       variable = "latq",
                                       unit = 1:131)),
                       parameter = par_wb,
                       start_date = "2000-01-01",
                        end_date = "2007-12-31",
                       output_interval = "y",
                       years_skip = 3,
                       revision = 57)
#Building 1 thread in 'data_input/SWAT_demo/swatplus_rev57_demo/.model_run': 
# Completed 1 thread in 0S                                                   
#Performing 1 simulation on 1 core: 
# Completed 1 simulation in 3S  
```

The simulated outputs provided by SWATplusR do not have the form yet that we 
require for the visualization. Therefore, some data wrangling is necessary as 
shown below:

```{r spatial output}
wb_hru_aa <- wb_hru$simulation %>% 
  select(-date) %>% 
  summarise_all(., .funs = mean) %>% 
  gather(.) %>% 
  mutate(hru = gsub("[^[:digit:]]", "",key) %>% as.numeric(.),
         wb_comp = gsub("[^[:alpha:]]", "",key)) %>% 
  select(hru, wb_comp, value) %>% 
  spread(., key = wb_comp, value = value)
```


To visualize the simulated values for each HRU we require the spatial 
information for all HRUs. The HRU map for the SWAT+ project can be acquired from 
SWATdata. Therefore, we us the R package sf:

```{r read hru shape}
hru_path <- load_demo("hru", version = "plus")

hru <- read_sf(hru_path) %>% 
  select(HRUS) %>% 
  mutate(HRUS = as.numeric(HRUS)) %>% 
  rename(hru = HRUS)
#> Warning: NAs introduced by coercion
```


The advantage of sf is that spatial data is simply treated as a data.frame and it is therefore easy to link the spatial reference to our simulated data:

```{r join output}
hru <- left_join(hru, wb_hru_aa, by = "hru")
```

Plotting spatial information with mapview is very intuitive. Here is a code example that allows you to compare different simulated components:

```{r plot spatial}
aet <- mapview(hru, zcol = "aet")
wyld <- mapview(hru, zcol = "wyld")
qlat <- mapview(hru, zcol = "qlat")
qsur <- mapview(hru, zcol = "qsur")

sync(aet, wyld, qlat, qsur)
```
